# Benson-Chrome-Extension
"Benson Motivation" is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused and avoid procrastination. Every time you navigate to YouTube, this extension will replace the thumbnails with a custom image, reminding you to get back to work. I have included example.png to show you what it's supposed to look like.
